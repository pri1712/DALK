Around 0.1% of the cases are familial forms of autosomal (not sex-linked) dominant inheritance, which have an onset before age 65. This form of the disease is known as early onset familial Alzheimer's disease. Most of autosomal dominant familial AD can be attributed to mutations in one of three genes: those encoding amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilins 1 and 2. Most mutations in the APP and presenilin genes increase the production of a small protein called Ab42, which is the main component of senile plaques. Some of the mutations merely alter the ratio between Ab42 and the other major forms--particularly Ab40--without increasing Ab42 levels. This suggests that presenilin mutations can cause disease even if they lower the total amount of Ab produced and may point to other roles of presenilin or a role for alterations in the function of APP and/or its fragments other than Ab. There exist variants of the APP gene which are protective.Most cases of Alzheimer's disease do not exhibit autosomal-dominant inheritance and are termed sporadic AD, in which environmental and genetic differences may act as risk factors. The best known genetic risk factor is the inheritance of the e4 allele of theapolipoprotein E (APOE). Between 40 and 80% of people with AD possess at least one APOEe4 allele. The APOEe4 allele increases the risk of the disease by three times in heterozygotes and by 15 times in homozygotes. Like many human diseases, environmental effects and genetic modifiers result in incomplete penetrance. For example, certain Nigerian populations do not show the relationship between dose of APOEe4 and incidence or age-of-onset for Alzheimer's disease seen in other human populations. Early attempts to screen up to 400 candidate genes for association with late-onset sporadic AD (LOAD) resulted in a low yield. More recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have found 19 areas in genes that appear to affect the risk. These genes include: CASS4, CELF1, FERMT2, HLA-DRB5, INPP5D, MEF2C, NME8, PTK2B, SORL1, ZCWPW1, SlC24A4, CLU, PICALM, CR1, BIN1, MS4A, ABCA7, EPHA1, and CD2AP.Mutations in the TREM2 gene have been associated with a 3 to 5 times higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. A suggested mechanism of action is that when TREM2 is mutated, white blood cells in the brain are no longer able to control the amount of beta amyloid present.Cholinergic hypothesisThe oldest, on which most currently available drug therapies are based, is the cholinergic hypothesis, which proposes that AD is caused by reduced synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. The cholinergic hypothesis has not maintained widespread support, largely because medications intended to treat acetylcholine deficiency have not been very effective. Other cholinergic effects have also been proposed, for example, initiation of large-scale aggregation of amyloid, leading to generalisedneuroinflammation.Amyloid hypothesisIn 1991, the amyloid hypothesis postulated that extracellular amyloid beta (Ab) deposits are the fundamental cause of the disease. Support for this postulate comes from the location of the gene for the amyloid precursor protein (APP) on chromosome 21, together with the fact that people with trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome) who have an extra gene copy almost universally exhibit at least the earliest symptoms of AD by 40 years of age. Also, a specific isoform of apolipoprotein, APOE4, is a major genetic risk factor for AD. Whilst apolipoproteins enhance the breakdown of beta amyloid, some isoforms are not very effective at this task (such as APOE4), leading to excess amyloid buildup in the brain. Further evidence comes from the finding that transgenic mice that express a mutant form of the human APP gene develop fibrillar amyloid plaques and Alzheimer's-like brain pathology with spatial learning deficits.An experimental vaccine was found to clear the amyloid plaques in early human trials, but it did not have any significant effect on dementia. Researchers have been led to suspect non-plaque Ab oligomers (aggregates of many monomers) as the primary pathogenic form of Ab. These toxic oligomers, also referred to as amyloid-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs), bind to a surface receptor on neurons and change the structure of the synapse, thereby disrupting neuronal communication. One receptor for Aboligomers may be the prion protein, the same protein that has been linked to mad cow disease and the related human condition, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, thus potentially linking the underlying mechanism of these neurodegenerative disorders with that of Alzheimer's disease. One study found possible evidence of human to human transmission.In 2009, this theory was updated, suggesting that a close relative of the beta-amyloid protein, and not necessarily the beta-amyloid itself, may be a major culprit in the disease. The theory holds that an amyloid-related mechanism that prunes neuronal connections in the brain in the fast-growth phase of early life may be triggered by ageing-related processes in later life to cause the neuronal withering of Alzheimer's disease. N-APP, a fragment of APP from the peptide's N-terminus, is adjacent to beta-amyloid and is cleaved from APP by one of the same enzymes. N-APP triggers the self-destruct pathway by binding to a neuronal receptor called death receptor 6 (DR6, also known as TNFRSF21). DR6 is highly expressed in the human brain regions most affected by Alzheimer's, so it is possible that the N-APP/DR6 pathway might be hijacked in the ageing brain to cause damage. In this model, beta-amyloid plays a complementary role, by depressing synaptic function.Tau hypothesisIn Alzheimer's disease, changes in tau protein lead to the disintegration of microtubules in brain cells.The tau hypothesis proposes that tau protein abnormalities initiate the disease cascade. In this model, hyperphosphorylated tau begins to pair with other threads of tau. Eventually, they form neurofibrillary tangles inside nerve cell bodies. When this occurs, the microtubules disintegrate, destroying the structure of the cell's cytoskeleton which collapses the neuron's transport system. This may result first in malfunctions in biochemical communication between neurons and later in the death of the cells.Other hypothesesA neurovascular hypothesis has been proposed which state that poor functioning of the blood brain barrier may be involved.The cellular homeostasis of biometals such as ionic copper, iron, and zinc is disrupted in AD, though it remains unclear whether this is produced by or causes the changes in proteins. These ions affect and are affected by tau, APP, and APOE, and their dysregulation may cause oxidative stress that may contribute to the pathology. Some studies have shown an increased risk of developing AD withenvironmental factors such as the intake of metals, particularly aluminium. The quality of some of these studies has been criticised, and the link remains controversial. The majority of researchers do not support a causal connection with aluminium.Smoking is a significant AD risk factor. Systemic markers of the innate immune system are risk factors for late-onset AD.There is tentative evidence that exposure to air pollution may be a contributing factor to the development of Alzheimer's disease.An infection with Spirochetes (a bacteria) in gum disease may cause dementia and may be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.Another scientific hypothesis is retrogenesis. Retrogenesis deals with the development and progress of Alzheimer's disease.

Aphasia and Apraxia).While many are irreversible, some have reversible causes- alcohol, head injury, deficiency states, metabolic and endocrinopathies.Alzheimer's dementia is due to progressive loss of neurons starting from basal nucleus (of Meynert) which in turn due to accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles (intracellular tau proteins) & amyloid plaques (extracellular Bamyloid) deposition.Since basal nucleus is the main place in brain where acetylcholine is synthesized (Ach is responsible for transferring immediate memory into short term memory), decline of memory is seen.Recently, aluminum has been implicated for Alzheimer's disease.Cortical dementiaSub-cortical dementiaMemory loss is early Aohassa is pronounced e.g., Alzheimer's dementiaMood & motor symptoms first Memory disturbance is late e.g., Parkinson.

Plaque and tanglesRef: Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease 9th Ed; Page No-1290Alzheimer disease is the most important cause of dementia in elderly.It usually begins after age of 50 years.Most cases are sporadic; only 5-10 of cases are familial.Pneumonia is the most common cause of death.Grossly:Cortical atrophy with narrowed gyri and widened sulci especially in the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes.Hydrocephalus ex vacuo also occurs due to cortical atrophy.Earliest sites involved are medial temporal lobe structure.Morphologic AbnormalitiesNeurofibrillary tangles (NFT):NFT are bundles of helical filaments in neural cytoplasm.It is hypo phosphorylated tau protein.Especially seen in the cerebral cortex.It is clearly visible by sliver (Bielschowsky) staining.Neuritic (senile) plaques:They are spherical collections of dilated, tortuous, neuritic processes (dystrophic neutrites) within the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala.A distinctive peptide structure is present around central amyloid core.Non-specific findings.Increased number of neuritic plaque correlates advanced age and severity of dementia.Granulovacuolar degeneration: is the intraneuronal cytoplasmic granule-containing small and clear vacuoles occurring within the pyramidal cells of the hippocampusAmyloid angiopathy: Almost Invariably accompanies Alzheimer disease. There is vascular p-amyloid deposition.Hirano bodies: Are the intracytoplasmic proximal dendritic eosinophilic inclusions containing actin protein.EtiologyAbnormal amyloid gene expression is the most favored etiologic concept today.Ap40 Aggregates are directly neurotoxic and it will induce synaptic damage of nucleus basalis of mayernet. This will decreases the brain content of the enzyme and its product acetylcholine, especially in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Acetylcholine plays a role in learning, and drugs that block its action adversely affect short-term memory.The APP gene located on chromosome 21; it encoded for amyloid precursor protein, a precursor to the Ab peptide. Mutations in the APP gene have been linked to familial Alzheimer disease.Down syndrome patients (trisomy 21) experience early onset Alzheimer disease secondary to gene dosage effect.Other genetic abnormalitiesInheritance of the[?]4 allele of apoprotein E is located in chromosome 19; is associated with greater frequency in patients with Alzheimer disease.Mutations in genes coding for presenilins.

They are insoluble and resistant to clearance remaining visible in tissue sections as \"ghost\" or \"tombstone\" tangles long after the death of the parent neuron.Ultrastructurally, they are composed of paired helical filaments along with some straight filaments.A major component of paired helical filaments is abnormally hyperphosphorylated forms of the protein tau. an axonal microtubule-associated protein that enhances microtubule assembly.Other components include MAP2 (microtubule-associated protein-2) and ubiquitin.Paired helical filaments are also found in the dystrophic neurites that form the outer portions of neuritic plaques and in axons coursing through the affected gray matter as neuropil threads.Other FeaturesCerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA).Granulovacuolar degeneration: Small (~5 mm in diameter), clear intraneuronal cytoplasmic vacuoles, each of which contains an argyrophilic granule.Hirano bodies are elongated, glassy, eosinophilic bodies consisting of paracrystalline arrays of beaded filaments, with actin as their major component, found most commonly within hippocampal pyramidal cells.Pathologic changes are evident earliest in the entorhinal cortex, then spread through the hippocampal formation and isocortex, and then extend into the neocortex.NIA-Reagan criteria used in the diagnosis.Remember:Amyloid plaques - Extracellular IJ amyloid.Neurofibrillary tangles - Intracellular tau proteins.", "subject_name": "Unknown", "topic_name": null, "entity": "1.

Enlargement of the ventricles with increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure is found, and therapeutic lumbar punctures may significantly improve symptoms. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a rare diffuse degenerative disease that usually affects people in their 50s, and the usual course is about one year. The terminal stage is characterized by severe dementia, generalized hypeonicity, and profound speech disturbances. It is one of several diseases presumably caused by prions. Huntington disease is a hereditary disease associated with progressive degeneration of the basal ganglia and the cerebral coex. It is transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern. The onset of Huntington disease occurs between 35 and 50 years of age, or later in rare cases. This disease is characterized by progressive dementia, muscular hypeonicity, and bizarre choreiform movements. Parkinson disease is characterized primarily by motor dysfunction, but dementia may be a pa of the disorder. The characteristic motor symptoms (bradykinesia, flat facies, resting tremor, shuffling gait, etc) are caused by degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic tract.

throughout the medial temporal lobes, as well as lateral and medial parietal lobes and lateral frontal cortex.'- Harrison 18th/3305Alzheimer's DiseaseAD can occur in any decade of adulthood, but it is the MC cause of dementia in the elderly.AD most often presents with an insidious onset of memory loss followed by a slowly progressive dementia over several years.Dementia from Alzheimer's disease is the classical prototype of cortical dementias.Alzheimer's dementia is the MC cortical dementiaQ.Predominantly affects the temporoparietal cortex (although frontal lobe is also frequently involved)Pathology:Pathologically, atrophy is distributed throughout the medial temporal lobes, as well as lateral and medial parietal lobes and lateral frontal cortex.Microscopically, there are neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (INFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau filaments, and accumulation of amyloid in blood vessel walls in cortex and leptomen ingesQ.At autopsy, the earliest and most severe degeneration is found in the medial temporal lobe (entorhinal/perirhinal cortex and hippocampus), lateral temporal cortex, and nucleus basalis of MeynertQ.Characteristic microscopic findings: Neuritic plaques and NFTsQ.Neurofibrillary tangles are intracellular accumulations that may appear extracellularly after degeneration of neuron (neuronal death)Q.A histopathological diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is made in cases of progressive dementia when beta-amyloid plaques (Neuritic/Senile plaques) co-occur with Neurofibrillary TanglesQ.Decreased levels of ACH, its synthetic enzyme choline acetyltransferase and nicotinic cholinergic receptors are the primary biochemical abnormality observed in ADQ.Beta-Amyloid Plaques (Extracellular)Neurofibrillary Tangles (Intracellular)* Formed by extracellular accumulation of beta amyloid deposits.* Neuritic or senile beta- amyloid plaques are an early histopathological sign of AD* Amyloid beta-protein accumulated in single neuritic plaques is toxic to surrounding structures and adjacent neurons.* Clinicopathological studies have shown that amyloid burden does not directly correlate with severity or duration of dementia* Formed by intracellular accumulation of hyper phosphorylated microtubule binding protein 'tau'.* NFT's occur in many neurodegenerative diseases and/or a group of diseases called 'taupathies' (Frontotemporal dementia, Pick's disease).* The co-occurrence of beta-amyloid plaques with NFT's suggests a diagnosis of AD.* NFT's are toxic to the neurons and neurons with NFT's eventually die and degenerate leaving a residual 'ghost tangle', in the extracellular space reminding of the pyramidal cell body in which it was initially formed.* Ciinicopathoiogical studies have shown that dementia correlates more strongly with NFT's than with senile plaques (beta- amyloid)Epidemiology:Most important risk factors for AD: Old age and positive family history.Factors associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease* Increasing ageQ* Female sexQ* Lower educational attainmentQ* Family history of dementiaQ* Environmental factors (Al, Hg, Viruses and Prions)* Genetic factors: Amyloid Precursor Protein on chromosomes 21Q, adult with trisomy 21 (Down's)QClinical Manifestations:The cognitive changes of AD tend to follow a characteristic pattern, beginning with memory impairment and spreading to language and visuospatial deficits.Changes in environment (such as vacations or hospital stays) may be disorienting.Language becomes impaired-first naming, then comprehension, and finally fluency.In some patients, aphasia is an early and prominent feature.Apraxia emerges, and patients have trouble performing learned sequential motor tasks.Visuospatial deficits begin to interfere with dressing, eating, or even walking, and patients fail to solve simple puzzles or copy geometric figures.Approximately 10% of AD patients develop Capgras' syndrome, believing that a caregiver has been replaced by an impostor.Often death results from malnutrition, secondary infections, pulmonary emboli, heart disease, or, most commonly, aspiration.As AD progresses, more distributed but usually posterior-predominant cortical atrophy becomes apparent, along with atrophy of the medial temporal memory structures.Slowly progressive decline in memory and orientation, normal results on laboratory tests, and an MRI or CT scan showing only distributed or posteriorly predominant cortical and hippocampal atrophy is highly suggestive of AD.Treatment:DonepeziI (target dose, 10 mg daily),Rivastigmine (target dose, 6 mg twice daily or 9.5-mg patch daily)Galantamine (target dose 24 mg daily, extended-release)Memantine (target dose, 10 mg

Clinico-pathological studies have shown that amyloid burden does not directly correlate with severity or duration of dementia.

Substances that cannot be metabolized accumulate in cells. Examples include:- (1) endogenous substrates that are not processed because a key enzyme is missing (lysosomal storage diseases) (2) insoluble endogenous pigments (lipofuscin and melanin) (3) exogenous paiculates (silica and carbon) Lipofuscin is a \"wear and tear\" pigment of aging that accumulates in organs such as the brain, hea, and liver.
